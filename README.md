# git-intro

A presentation on the basics of Git, including some personal views.

I used this as a chance to explore building presentations with the R package [`xarignan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).  I did not think through sharing the files so I manually copied the `git-intro.html` and saved it as `index.html` in order to create a github page.  This was not wise, but alas it will do.
