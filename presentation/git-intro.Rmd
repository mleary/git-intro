# How does Git work

Git doesn't track when you save the file, <span class="orange-bold">you need to commit the changes</span> 

Commiting files documents the changes you've made

Commiting > Saving

Rule of thumb, commit changes daily

Github is a service provider, that hosts git repositories

Some additional service providers:

*  Bitbucket

*  <span class="orange-bold">TFS/Azure DevOps</span>

# Some common Git questions

<span class="orange-bold">Q: What if I don't want to track a file?</span>

A: You can do that!  Use a .gitignore file.

# Some common Git terms

<span class="orange-bold">**Repo**</span> - Short for repository - Really just a folder or place with files

<span class="orange-bold">**Origin/Remote**</span> - where "real" code lives and is shared (TFS, Github)

<span class="orange-bold">**Local**</span> - Your personal copy of remote

<span class="orange-bold">**Clone**</span> - Copying origin/remote repo to your local computer

<span class="orange-bold">**Branch**</span> - A "draft version", where you can work on code and not impact others

<span class="orange-bold">**Commit**</span> - Documenting changes 

<span class="orange-bold">**Pull Request**</span> - Asking others to accept your changes
